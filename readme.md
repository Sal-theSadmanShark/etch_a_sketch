my initial plan to to add nothing to the html file except the source links . I want to use DOM to design the whole page . This is my hardest project so far , and i c an say i've done enough . I'm startin to write the code on 22th july at 1:30 pm , lets see how long it takes. 

its exactly 1:30 am and i've finsihed the project ! or at least i've finished the main skeleton , the styling is still left . This seemed overwhelming at first but it turned out way easier than i thought . Maybe it's just miscalculation or maybe i've actually become a better coder :D
